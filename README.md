<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] basic user interactions
- [x] the bot is able to read messages in the channel and send them to the user as a hyperlink to these messages
- [x] messages from the channel are added to the database and sent to the user in private messages after the command
- [ ] the user can choose the time period for which he will receive the message
- [ ] Multi-language Support
    - [ ] Chinese
    - [ ] Spanish
- [ ] The user receives a weekly digest based on the messages from the channel preprocessed using YandexGpt. The digest includes a hyperlink to the original message, a summary of the post, and so on for each message in the time interval selected by the user. The digest is duplicated in two languages: Russian and English. Next, the user can send the created digest directly to the channel.
